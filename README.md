# Philosophers
##### I never thought philosophy would be so deadly

###### This is a project about threading processes and mutexes

:mag_right:\
    `The Philosophers project at 42 is a coding assignment that simulates the classic Dining Philosophers Problem
    to demonstrate concurrency control, resource management, and synchronization techniques.
    The project requires the use of C programming language and multithreading
    to implement a solution that prevents deadlocks and resource conflicts`

• One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
• The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.
• There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.
• Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.
• When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
a philosopher dies of starvation.
• Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
• Philosophers don’t speak with each other.
• Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.
• No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!
